### Hi, ðŸ‘‹

I am Antti. I am working as a Research Scientist at the [Research Unit of Medical Imaging, Physics and Technology](https://github.com/MIPT-Oulu), University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland. I have received my Master of Science degree in Information Engineering (Engineering Mathematics) from the same university. I am currently pursuing towards the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Medicine (Medical Physics and Technology). My most recent research interests lie in the area of deep learning and medical image analysis.
